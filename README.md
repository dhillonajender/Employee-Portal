# Employee-Portal

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) example application that I built using Spring Boot and React. It showcases how to develop a full-stack web application with a backend implemented in Spring Boot and a frontend developed using React. I used MySQL database and Postman for API testing. 

In this application, I performed basic CRUD operations on a Employee table. It provides a user-friendly interface where we can create new employee records, view existing records, update them, and delete them.

The backend of the application is developed using Spring Boot, which is a Java framework for building web applications. I utilized Spring Data JPA, which simplifies database operations, and created RESTful APIs that the frontend can use to interact with the backend. The backend takes care of the business logic, data persistence, and exposes API endpoints for performing CRUD operations.

In the React part of the project, I utilized components to structure the frontend user interface. React Router was employed for routing, enabling navigation between different pages. State management was achieved using React's built-in state management system i.e, useState hooks, allowing for dynamic data and interactive components. Form handling was demonstrated, capturing user input, validating it, and submitting it to the backend. Axios was used for making asynchronous API requests to the backend. Overall, the React part showcases the power of React in creating reusable components, handling forms, managing state, and interacting with backend APIs.

One of the main highlights of this project is the seamless integration between the Spring Boot backend and the React frontend. I have implemented HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend APIs and handled the responses efficiently. The project follows the principles of separation of concerns and modularity, resulting in a clean and scalable codebase.
